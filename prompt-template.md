**### Prompt V18 ###**

1.  **Initial Prediction:** For the next given football match using the system date, make a preliminary score prediction based on intuition, odds, or basic context. Save this prediction mentally or on a conceptual "scratchpad."
2.  **Analysis Target:** Focus analysis on the specific match provided.
3.  **Iterative Analysis Loop & Conceptual Data Handling:**
    Follow the "Data Check" steps (Step 4) below for the targeted match.
    *   **Conceptual Scratchpad & Context:** Throughout this process, findings are stored conceptually on a "scratchpad" used during the generation of the response. This collected information forms the basis for subsequent analysis steps. Check the scratchpad for completeness before moving to calculations or subsequent steps.
    *   **Dynamic Gap Filling & Persistence:** Actively attempt to fill data gaps identified during the process by performing additional, targeted searches as detailed in the relevant sections of Step 4. **Crucially, do not proceed to the next analytical calculation or step if the required input data (e.g., HT scores, goal times) for that step is marked as missing on the scratchpad.** Continue searching for the specific missing data point(s) using targeted queries until the data is found or confirmed as definitively unobtainable after reasonable attempts.
    *   **Iteration:** If newly found data significantly changes the picture (e.g., correcting form data), iterate through relevant parts of Step 4 again, refining the analysis based on the updated information on the scratchpad.
    *   **Prompt Chaining Context:** The complete analysis presented in the response (incorporating initially found and dynamically searched data) becomes part of the conversation history. This history serves as the context for subsequent prompts (prompt chaining), allowing follow-up questions or refinements to build upon the established analysis. The "storage" mechanism is this contextual carry-forward within the conversation session.
    *   **Continuation of Steps:** Retrieve previous output and stored scratchpad data to find where the last step was complete or incomplete, continuing from that position, ensuring required data for the current step is present before executing it.
4.  **Data Check:** Perform the following analysis points, using grounded search where necessary:

        *   **Conceptual Scratchpad Storage:** Store the synthesized home/away dynamic summary.

5.  **Final Prediction:** Based on the comprehensive analysis drawing from **all** stored findings on the conceptual scratchpad:
    *   **Synthesize Key Findings & Weighing Factors:**
        *   Explicitly list the strongest arguments *for* each team winning or a draw, referencing key data points (League position, Recent Form record + streak context, significant H2H patterns, Home/Away synthesis from 4.9, key player news, motivation edge from 4.5).
        *   **Crucially, state how conflicting data (e.g., Form vs H2H, Form vs Season-long Home/Away, Analysis vs Odds) is being weighed.** Justify prioritizing one factor over another (e.g., "While H2H favours Team B, Team A's current 8-game winning streak and perfect home form is deemed more indicative of immediate potential and outweighs H2H from 1-2 seasons ago").
    *   **Identify Plausible Scenarios:** Briefly outline 2-3 plausible match narratives based on the weighted synthesis.
    *   **Determine Primary Prediction Format:** (e.g., Match Outcome + Total Goals).
    *   **State Primary Match Outcome Prediction:** (e.g., Team A Win, Draw, Team B Win).
    *   **Market Odds Check & Confidence Adjustment:** Review the odds discrepancy highlighted in 4.7. If the primary prediction strongly contradicts the market favourite, briefly reiterate why and state whether this lowers confidence or if the value assessment remains strong. Consider if a more conservative prediction (e.g., Double Chance, Draw-No-Bet market equivalent) might be wiser if confidence is reduced.
    *   **(Optional) Acknowledge Secondary Scenarios:** Briefly mention less likely but possible outcomes.
    *   **Predict Total Goals (Over/Under 2.5):** State O/U Prediction based on synthesis (Form O/U%, H2H O/U%, inferred tactics, team GF/GA trends, weather). (Optional) Confidence level.
    *   **Formulate Most Robust Combined Prediction:** (e.g., Team A Win and Under 2.5 goals).
    *   **Scoreline(s) (Contextual):** Suggest specific scoreline(s) aligning with the outcome and O/U prediction. **Justify the chosen scoreline(s) by referencing relevant factors:** Does ES/ST data (if available) suggest an early or late goal? Do Reliability/Choke percentages support a narrow win vs. a comfortable one? Does the FTS% suggest a 1-0 is more likely than 2-1?
    *   **Justification:** Provide a concise rationale weaving together the key arguments, the weighing of conflicting data, the odds check, and how the scoreline reflects timing/reliability insights (if applicable/significant) to support the final combined prediction. State clearly if ES/ST/Reliability data was unavailable or considered inconclusive for this specific match.
